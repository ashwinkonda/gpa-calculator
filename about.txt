Welcome to the GPA Calculator!

Description:

    The GPA Calculator is a user-friendly tool designed to help you accurately calculate your GPA through 
    a command-line interface. It utilizes a standard grading scale commonly used across the United States.
    The program also presents your academic information in a well-organized manner using tables.

Instructions:

    1. Add a Semester: Start by adding a semester to the program. This step is crucial before you can begin recording classes
    for a specific term.

    2. Add Classes: Once a semester is added, you can input the classes and their respective grades. Grades MUST be letter grades
    from the grading scale.

    3. Calculate GPA: You can calculate your GPA at any time during the process.

    4. Exit: When you are finished, you can exit the program. All your grades and academic information will be securely saved 
    in an SQLite database for future reference.

Grading Scale:

    A = 4.0
    A- = 3.67

    B- 2.67
    C+ = 2.33
    C = 2.00
    C- = 2.00
    D = 1.00
