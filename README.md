## Project Structure

### .py files:
* project.py: The main script that runs the GPA Calculator. It handles user input, GPA calculation, and interaction with the database.
* database.py: Handles and executes all database operations, including storing and retrieving GPA data using SQLite.
* test_project.py: Performs tests for crucial functions within project.py using Pytest, which is a Python testing framework. This script only runs when it is explicitely called using `pytest test_project.py`

### .db files:
* gpa_data.db: This file will be created when you first run the program using `python project.py`. This is a database file that stores all of your GPA data. NOTE: If this file is deleted, your GPA data will be deleted as well.

### .txt files:
* about.txt: This is a user-friendly file that explains how the GPA Calculator program works and gives users important information on its usage. The contents of this file can be displayed within the program when the user chooses to view it, offering immediate help and instructions while the program is running.
* requirements.txt: This file contains all the necessary packages needed for the program to run accordingly. You can download all the packages within this file by simply running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### .md files:
* README.md: This file serves as the comprehensive documentation for the GPA Calculator project. It provides essential information and instructions, and it's the very document you are reading right now!
